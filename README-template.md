## Overview
Kicki and Tshepiso decided to collaborate on this project as a challenge. This is the first time we work together. We created the page in React and used Git, Github and Github projects to structure our work. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
We started our project with setting up a plan for how to collaborate and set up rules with esLint and prettier for consistensy. We divided the work between us and worked on small tasks until we met up again to plan ahead. We asked for reviews before merging branches and checked in with each other from time to time. 

The project itself was straight forward, we decided on what components we needed and then wrote them along with styling. The site is coded mobile first and the layout is responsive. We decided to write the news in json-files even though they are tiny, but a possible development of this project can be to add more news to display and to add more pages. Right now the page is static, the project only includes the start page. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I, Kicki, have learned quite a lot from Tshepiso about how to structure the workflow professionally and to work with esLint and pull request templates. It was a challenge to create consistensy in all of the aspects, everything from naming classes to where to put styling (and everything in between). This has been a great experience and I'm thankful for the oportunity to collaborate like this. 


Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
